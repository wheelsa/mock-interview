# Mock Interview Web App

This ReadMe is here to summarize the Mock Interview Web app I've created for
Devpoint Labs. 

NOTE: This app was created using rails for backend and react for front
end. For details on what libraries I used please check the gems file for Rails
, and package.json in the client folder for React.

## What you can expect from this app:

* A display of seeded items on the main page. These items will include a name,
  image, description, and the amount of likes.

* The ability to sort seeded items, either ascending or descending.

* The ability to create items with validation.




### Some Additional Notes:

  * When you clone the repo, don't forget to run bundle in the parent
    application folder, and yarn in the client folder. 

  * Create a local database and seed it to properly display items.

  * To run the app, run the rails server in http://localhost:3001/ (rails s -p
    3001), and cd into the client folder to run react in http://localhost:3000/
    (yarn start)
